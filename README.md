# Linear Inverse modeling
A LIM prototype.

LIM_utils: some useful functions about LIM. detailed descriptions are listed here.

LIM: main function to construt a LIM.

Nyquist_check: check for Nyquist mode. It refers to sampling question: if the sampled frequency is less than the minimal oscillation, some illusory mode will appear.

Q_test: ensure your LIM is accurately contrusted.

tau_test: ensure the dynamical operator is insensitive to the selection of tau.

heatmap: draw **L**.

error test: ensure LIM's forecst are good and error growth is identical to the theoretical growth.

optimal_state: related to forecasts of opportunity.

forecast: use your LIM to forecast.

long_run: use LIM to run a climatogical experiment. Aims at climatology research.
